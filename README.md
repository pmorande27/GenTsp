# GenTsp
GenTsp is a Hybrid Genetic Algorithm used to obtain High Quality answers for TSP optimisation problem in  polynomial time.
## Introduction
The TSP is a well known NP-hard problem, meaning that there is no current algorithm able to give the overall best possible solution in polynomial time for this problem. Many techniques have been proposed to get approximate answers for this problem. GenTSP implements a Hybrid Genetic Algorithm that aims to provide high quality answers for this problem. This algorithm has proven to be more effective than other simplier heursitics such as 2-Opt ot Greedy.

## Description
Genetic algorithms (GA) are inspired in biological process of Natural selection. This process dominates the evolution of species in the biological world, the main idea behind it is that the individuals with the best genes have higher probabilities of surviving. Therefore, the best genes (Qualities) of each generation are more likely to pass to the next one. This concept can be used as an Heuristic method to get good solutions to optimisation problems such as TSP.
